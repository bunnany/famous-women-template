            <p>Rosa Parks, born in 1913, was an African-American civil rights activist who played a significant role in the U.S. civil rights movement. Her act of defiance on December 1, 1955, when she refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama, sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and became a symbol of resistance against racial segregation. Parks' courageous action and steadfast commitment to equality helped galvanize the civil rights movement and inspire generations of activists.</p>
            
            <p>Rosa Parks' act of defiance was a catalyst for change, leading to the eventual desegregation of public transportation and paving the way for the larger struggle for civil rights. Throughout her life, Parks continued to advocate for racial equality, fighting against discrimination and injustice. Her legacy serves as a reminder of the power of individual actions to challenge systemic oppression and ignite social change.</p>
